#### Assumptions ####

# First and important: the recidivism rates and prison terms are determined by historical data. These *will* change with the JRI. Recidivism rates are likely to go down as a function of the number of parole and probabtion violations. Whether crime rates do is anyone's guess, since there is not a lot of money for rehabilitation. 
# There are ways to model this very simple using the recid_reduction_ovr_cntrl argument of the load_survival_data, but this only allows you to assume a reduction in re-arrests, not a change in the frequency of parole and probation violations.
# For future versions, we may want to think more about refining these estimates. 




#### Load data from national and local sources for calculating probabilities ####

## Prison terms ##
# Replaced national data with Utah specific data
# I pieced this data together using an email from Julie Christensen, which contained recidivism rates for the COD demographic, and the Justice Reinvestment Report, which contained the average sentencing:
# http://justice.utah.gov/Documents/CCJJ/Reports/Justice_Reinvestment_Report_2014.pdf
# http://www.acluutah.org/criminal-justice/item/download/15_0cfccf37c91e9fb16be4ac2e89ca12f2
# Crime costs come from this report, which I extrapolated for parole violations:
# http://www.justice.utah.gov/Documents/CCJJ/Cost%20of%20Crime/Utah%20Cost%20of%20Crime%202012%20-%20Methods%20Review%20Cost.pdf
# Before getting to the crime types and average sentences, though, it's important to grasp this statistic: 70% of parolees are returned on a technical violation.
prison_terms <- read.csv("./clean_data/utah_cod_recidivism_rates.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(mean_time_served = round(mean_time_served))

# I do these so that I can add a blank in the function below

prison_terms[8,4] <- 0



## Loads data on survival analysis, i.e., the time it takes people to recidivate, and turn it into a DF with the probability someone will recdiviate given the month free 
# The two arguments define the recidivism baseline and reduction:
# cntrl_inc_ovr_ntnl = what is the % increase (not % point increase) in our control group over national data (which looks similar to Utah's)? If 0, same as national trends
# recid_reduction_ovr_cntrl = having defined the control group above, what is the % we expect the program to reduce recidivism?
# The data that Julie sent suggest that the national trends for recidivism are very similar to the Utah trends (or at least they were between 2012 and 2015).
# The data also show that our study group had a recidivsm rate that was 74.3% after 36 months, whereas all prisoners had a rate of 64.2% (again, close to natural). The difference between the control group and national trends is (74.3 - 64.2) / 64.2, which I will list as the default arg for the function below: cntrl_inc_ovr_ntnl <- 0.157
